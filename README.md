# Micasa
Micasa is my long-term project to build a partial clone of Picasa.  The functionality I need built is the 
album creation functionality.  Photo editing in Micasa can be very basic, with anything futher being done 
through a real editor like Photoshop.

Micasa writes all updates to dot files as well as the images themselves; should Micasa be configured to write
to the images.
